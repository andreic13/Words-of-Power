Collaborated as a team of 4 students to fine-tune TinyLlama using a custom set of 77 words and defined specific rules for how they defeat each other. After training, we prompt the model with a "system" word, and it responds by selecting a word from the 77 that would defeat it according to the rules. This project demonstrates controlled fine-tuning for strategic word selection.
